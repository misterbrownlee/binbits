#
#   TL;DR:
#   ~/.bash_profile should be super-simple and just load .profile and .bashrc (in that order)
#   ~/.profile has the stuff NOT specifically related to bash, such as environment variables (PATH and friends)
#   ~/.bashrc has anything you'd want at an interactive command line.
#   like Command prompt, EDITOR variable, bash aliases for my use
#   note that ~/.bashrc punts if it detects and interacdtive shell
#

. ~/.profile
. ~/.bashrc
